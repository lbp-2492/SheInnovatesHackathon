SheInnovatesHackathon submission.
This project was created during the SheInnovates 24 hour virtual hackathon in 2022. 

About
Our team developed a user-friendly recipe finding app for college students that enables users to search for recipes based on their personal preferences, restrictions, and items they have available. This helps reduce food waste by providing recipe ideas using ingredients the user already has.

The app allows users to filter potential recipes by:

Dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.)
Ingredients
Cuisine type
Meal type

This app was built using:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, React
Backend: MealDB API
Tools: GitHub, Visual Studio Code

Usage
To use this app:

Visit the live site at 
Enter available ingredients
Refine by cuisine, meal type
Browse recipe results fitting criteria
Click any recipe for detailed ingredients and instructions

This project was completed by:

Team lead, Back End Developer: Leela Pinnamaraju
Front End Developer: Leela Pinnamaraju, Grace Sweeney, Laiba Awan
QA: Gabbie Fernandez 

We successfully completed this fully functional recipe finder app within the 24 hour hackathon timeframe.

Future Improvements
Some potential ways to improve this app in the future:

Incorporate additional recipe databases for more variety
Build user accounts to save favorite recipes
Refine UI/UX based on user testing
Expand filtering and search capabilities
