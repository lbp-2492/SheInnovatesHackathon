#SheInnovatesHackathon submission.
###This project was created during the SheInnovates 24 hour virtual hackathon in 2022. 

##About
Our team developed a user-friendly recipe finding app for college students that enables users to search for recipes based on their personal preferences, restrictions, and items they have available. This helps reduce food waste by providing recipe ideas using ingredients the user already has.

##The app allows users to filter potential recipes by:
Ingredients
Random 

##This app was built using:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, React
Backend: MealDB API
Tools: GitHub, Visual Studio Code

##Usage
To use this app:

Clone the github repo
Use Go Live on index.html
Enter ingredients or choose a random recipe
Browse recipe results fitting criteria
Click any recipe for detailed ingredients and instructions

##The Team
This project was completed by:
Team lead, Back End Developer: Leela Pinnamaraju
Front End Developer: Leela Pinnamaraju, Grace Sweeney, Laiba Awan
QA: Gabbie Fernandez 

We successfully completed this fully functional recipe finder app within the 24 hour hackathon timeframe.

##Future Improvements
Some potential ways to improve this app in the future:
* Incorporate additional recipe databases for more variety
* Build user accounts to save favorite recipes
* Refine UI/UX based on user testing
* Expand filtering and search capabilities
